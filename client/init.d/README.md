This folder contains scripts for starting the [PiScanner](../../binaries/linux/arm/PiScanner) and [WebApp](../../binaries/linux/arm/WebApp) programs automatically, when the Pi boots.

These scripts are based on [this article](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/2012/06/raspberry-pi-run-program-at-start-up.html) by [Martin O'Hanlon](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/).
